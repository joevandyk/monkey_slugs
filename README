Dead simple slug library. Automatically generates a non-changing uuid for
each row in your tables. Generates URLs like 
http://www.tanga.com/deals/your-product-name/dka339da, 
where the 'your-product-name' text in the URL can change at anytime.
Also does easy redirects to the new URLs if the product name changes.

Instructions:

1. Add a column to your table called 'uuid'. 
This column should be not null and unique.
If this table already has data in it, you'll 
need to populate each row with a unique identifier.

Example (in postgres):
   alter table questions add column uuid character varying unique;
   update questions set uuid = substr(md5(random()::text), 0, 8);
   alter table questions alter column uuid set not null;


2. In your model, add the following:
   # The friendly name in the URL is based on the title parameter.
   class Question < ActiveRecord::Base
     MonkeySlugs.sluggify self, :how => proc { title.parameterize }
   end
  
This will generate URLs like:
    question_url(question) => /questions/some-title-here/8d8asfs3


3. In your routes, add a constraint for the resource like:
    resources :questions, :constraints => MonkeySlugs::ROUTE

This allows for routes with slashes in the :id segment.


4. (optional) In your controller, if you want to redirect to the canonical path, do
    redirect_to question_url(@question) and return if !@question.correct_friendly_name?(params[:id])

that's it.
